This is a working collaborative TODO list. Please keep it up to date as you see
fit. In the short term, let's focus on what it takes to make a solid 4.0
release!

[COMPATIBILITY]

 - Resolve this question of consistency versus compatibility for expires('param',0);
   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12244228

[INTERNALS]

 - Make the code easier to follow by moving subroutines
   next to their documentation. That allows you to confirm
   at a glance that the code and documentation for a routine
   match, and keep them in sync easier. 

[ MISSING FEATURES / WISHLIST ] 

 - Develop a CGI application to duplicate all the tests in t/gr_*.t scripts
   in its natural environment. This application should require separate run-modes to
   thoroughly test all the features of CGI::Session. Its output and navigation, 
   although meant for humans, should also be easy to be consumed by automated agents 
   using WWW::Mechanize and similar.

 - DBI-related drivers should provide a method for initializing required database tables
   for storing sessions. This method must initialize tables only if they are missing. So
   it should be safe to invoke the method on databases where session tables already exist.

 - Consider adding a redirect() method, as proposed here:
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2603 
   The bug report has some starter code, but docs and tests are still needed.  

 - Allow CGI::Session->new( $dbh );
   This syntax would automatically figure out the CGI::Session driver name
   based on the DBI driver. This can't work in every case because there is
   not a 1-to-1 correspondence. For example, the PureSQL driver is an alternate
   database back-end. Still, because it can address the common cases with MySQL
   and PostgreSQL drivers, it seems worthwhile.

 - Ticket #8090 Change to clear method allows clearing based on regular expression. 
   Code patch has been submitted. Still need docs and test.

 - Serialized session data should include some meta-information about the way
   it is created. This will allow **truly** automated disk-cleanup features to be implemented.
   This meta-table should have such information as the name of the serializer, id-generator,
   name of the application that created it, version of CGI::Session, and version of the serializer
   used. These changes, when properly implemented, should have no effect on current driver nor 
   serializer specifications.

 - CGI::Session should not depend on existence of ENV variables when running under mod_perl environment.
 - Apache::Request needs to be used if running under mod_perl
