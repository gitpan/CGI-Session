NAME

CGI::Session 2.2 - Perl extension for persistent session management in CGI 
applications

SYNOPSIS

    use CGI::Session::DB_File;
    use CGI;

    my $cgi = new File;

    # get the user's session id either from the cookie, or from the query_string.
    # If it is  not present, create a new session for the visitor
    my $session;
    {
        my $sid = $cgi->cookie("SITE_SID") || $cgi->param("sid") || undef;

        $session  = new CGI::Session::File($sid, { FileName=>'sessions.db',
                                                     LockDirectory=>'/tmp'});
    }

    # now, don't forget to send the session id back as a cookie
    {
        my $cookie = $cgi->cookie(-name=>"SITE_SID", -value=>$session->id);
        print $cgi->header(-cookie=>$cookie);
    }


    # now, if the user submitted his first name in a form, we can save it
    # in our session
    my $first_name  = $cgi->param("first_name");
    $session->param("first_name", $first_name);


    # if it is an old session, we can recognize the user and greet him
    # with his first name:
    if ( $session->param("first_name") ) {
        print "Hello ", $session->param("first_name"), " how have you been?\n";
        print "You last visited the site on ", scalar(localtime($session->atime));
    }

    # posibilities are endless!

C<CGI::Session> provides with just that. You can read the whole documentation
as a tutorial on session management. But if you are already familiar with
