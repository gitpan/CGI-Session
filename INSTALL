INSTALLATION
============

Using CPAN Interactive shell
----------------------------

    % perl -MCPAN -e shell
    cpan> install CGI::Session

Using Makefile.PL
--------------------

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

If you don't have proper permissions to perform system-wide 
installations you can install CGI::Session to your private 
PERL5LIB folder:

    % perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perllib
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

Above set of commands install CGI::Session to your ~/perllib folder.

TESTING
========

You are encouraged to run tests for the backend you will be using. 
The database backends that need a customized connection string won't 
run by default. To run them, some environment variables must be set.

The simplest method is to use the standard "DBI_DSN" environment variable 
to define a DBI connection string. Otherwise, you can set these variables 
as well:

For PostgreSQL:
    CGISESS_PGSQL_DSN
    CGISESS_PGSQL_USER
    CGISESS_PGSQL_PASSWORD

For MySQL:
    CGISESS_MYSQL_DSN
    CGISESS_MYSQL_USER
    CGISESS_MYSQL_PASSWORD
    CGISESS_MYSQL_SOCKET
