CGI::Session Change Log
=====================================================================

4.07 - Thursday, March 9th, 2006

    * INTERNAL: MANIFEST update to fix release. 

4.06 - Wednesday, March 8th, 2006

    * FIX: some stray warnings when flushing:  "Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==)" (RT#14603)
    * NEW: JSON and YAML serializers (Tyler MacDonald)
    * INTERNAL: CGI::Session::Test::Default accepts a "skip" argument,
      listing tests that should be skipped. (Tyler)

4.05 - Friday, March 3rd, 2006
    * FIX: Race condition fixed when writing to session files (RT#17949)

4.04 - Wednesday, March 01, 2006
    * NEW: File driver now has option to disable flock (for those running
      Win 9x, VMS, MacPerl, VOS and RISC OS). (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: If DBI driver wass initialized using 'Handle', Driver::DBI::init()
      returned false, and Driver::new() thought init faild and kept returning
      undef. The problem was fixed by making sure Driver::DBI::init() returned
      true. (Sherzod)
    * Added .*cgisess.* to disclude cgisess.db, cgisess.id, and any session
      files created in the t directory. (Matt LeBlanc)

    * FIX: File driver now respects $CGI::Session::File::FileName for 3.9x
      compatibility. (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: Default serializer now properly handles data structures that appear
      more than once in the serialized data structure (before it'd result in data 
      structures that were equivalent but did not have the same address). (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: File driver now localizes the filehandle to avoid any possibility
      of extended locking in persistent environments (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: File driver now locks the file when retrieving the session data (Matt LeBlanc)
    * NEW: DBI Drivers now support a lazy loaded database handle. This is useful with the
      CGI::Application plugin system. If the session is never used, the database handle may not
      not need to be created. The syntax is to use a code ref: 
        Handle => sub {DBI->connect} (Mark Stosberg)

    Finally, be aware that since 4.0 some people have reported problems with
    the auto-flushing code. There may be an unresolved. You always  call
    flush() to be safe. Input or code contributions for the issue are
    appreciated. Some related tickets include:

4.03 - Wednesday, October 05, 2005
    * FIX: automatic flushing did not work if session object was global
    * FIX: Default serializer can now serialize objects (Matt LeBlanc)
    * INTERNAL: SQLite driver no longer needs MIME::Base64 for encoding (Matt LeBlanc)

4.02 - Friday, September 02, 2005
    * FIX: remote_addr() was missing (RT #14414])

4.01 - Thursday, September 01, 2005
    * FIX: Minor POD fix

4.00 - Wednesday, August 31, 2005

    *** NOTE ***
    The 4.0 release represents a major overhaul of the CGI::Session code base.
    Care has been taken to be 100% compatible with applications developed with 3.x.
    However, you are encouraged to run regression tests with your own applications
    before using this in production.

    * NEW: PostgreSQL driver enhanced to work better with binary serializers (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: update to un tainting in default serializer to make "-T" happy (Matt LeBlanc)
    * FIX: CGI::Session (qw/-ip_match/), a 3.x feature, works again (Shawn Sorichetti)
    * INTERNAL: Improved documentation shown during "make", which explains how to run
      database-driven tests. (Mark Stosberg)
    * FIX: to support binary serializers SQLite driver uses MIME::Base64 (Sherzod Ruzmetov)

    * FIX: documented etime(), which was present in 3.x (Mark Stosberg)
