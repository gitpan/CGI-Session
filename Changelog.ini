* INTERNAL: Rename SimpleObjectClass to CGI::Session::Test::SimpleObjectClass
to avoid namespace ownership issue (Mark Stosberg).
* INTERNAL: We now list CGI.pm 3.26 or greater as a dependency. You are still
welcome to use other query objects but this version of CGI.pm
fixes a bug in the strictness of HTTP expiration times which
Safari in particular is sensitive to. So if you are using
CGI.pm you should upgrade to at least this version. RT#34216
thanks to Astar Michael Hampton Ron Savage and Mark Stosberg.
* INTERNAL: return explicit values in _set_status and _unset_status
(RT#39201 Mario Domgoergen Mark Stosberg)
* FIX: RT#37877: The storable serializer wasn't properly inheriting the 'errstr'
method. This could have resulted an error like:
"Can't locate errstr via package "CGI::Session::Serialize::storable"
Thanks to Michael Greenish Mark Stosberg.
* FIX: RT#40405 reported a case where the default serializer would have a problem after the user
set a parameter's value to undef in certain circumstances.
A test file was kindly provided by cowomally[...]nullium.net.
The fix was spelled out by Matt LeBlanc
* FIX: RT#39679 pointed out a simplification in method remove() in CGI::Session::Driver::file.
By calling _file() instead of duplicating code we get the benefit of extra error checking.
Thanx to Sergiy Borodych for noticing this
* FIX: Stop using the return value of delete() in t/find.t. This means that when the patch
provided in RT#37752 is applied t/find.t will not start failing

* SECURITY: Patch CGI::Session::Driver::file to stop \ and / characters being used in
session ids and hence in file names. These characters possibly combined with '..'
could have been used to access files outside the designated session file directory.
Reported by TAN Chew Keong of vuln.sg.
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session to propagate error upwards when _load_pluggables() fails.
See RT#37628 and http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=490198.
* INTERNAL: Ship a machine-readable version of this file under the name Changelog.ini.
The latter file is generated by ini.report.pl which is shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes.
The reason Changelog.ini does not contain a separate section for each version in this file
is that some of the versions documented below have no datestamp and ini.report.pl does not create
fake datestamps.

Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session::Driver::mysql to replace 'REPLACE INTO ...' with
'INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...'. See RT#37069.
Thanks to Steve Kirkup for the patch. I (Ron) installed MySQL V 5.0.51a for testing.
Note: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-cs-5-0-45.html and similar docs
list various MySQL errors fixed recently for the above new syntax. Also the new version
is now much more like the Postgres code which is another reason it has been adopted.
* FIX: t/mysql.t used to test setting the global variable $CGI::Session::MySQL::TABLE_NAME.
The test for this (in t/mysql.t) was introduced in V 4.00_09.
However since V 4.29_1 changes to CGI::Session::Driver's new() method mean
this way of setting the session table's name no longer works and so the variable
$CGI::Session::MySQL::TABLE_NAME is now not used. Hence it has been removed.
Code in CGI::Session::Driver::DBI used to set $class::TABLE_NAME for all database drivers.
This code has also been removed. Moral: Don't use global variables.
Call $session = CGI::Session -> new(... ... (TableName => 'new_name'}) or
after creating the object call $session -> table_name('new_name').
To retrieve the name call $name = $session -> table_name().

[V 4.31]
Date=2008-06-10T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session::Driver::DBI to check that the DBI handle still exists before trying
to ping it. This handles the case where the DBI object is destroyed before the session object.
See RT#35925.
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session::Driver::DBI's remove() which still hard-coded the column name 'id' instead
of using the new feature which allows the user to specify the name of the column. See RT#36235.
* FIX: Patch POD yet again to emphasize that an explicit call to destroy() should be followed by
explicit call to flush() in particular in the case where the program is not exiting and
hence auto-flushing is not activated. Sections patched are 'A Warning about Auto-flushing'
and the docs for delete(). See RT#34668.
EOT

[V 4.30]
Date=2008-04-25T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Patch POD for CGI::Session in various places to emphasize even more that auto-flushing is
unreliable and that flush() should always be called explicitly before the program exits.
The changes are a new section just after SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION and the PODs for flush()
and delete(). See RT#17299 and RT#34668
* NEW: Add t/new_with_undef.t and t/load_with_undef.t to explicitly demonstrate the effects of
calling new() and load() with various types of undefined or fake parameters. See RT#34668
* FIX: Patch POD for new() and load() to clarify the result of calling these with undef or with
an initialized CGI object with an undefined or fake CGISESSID. See RT#34668.
Specifically: You are strongly advised to run the old-fashioned
'make test TEST_FILES=t/new_with_undef.t TEST_VERBOSE=1' or the new-fangled
'prove -v t/new_with_undef.t' for both new*.t and load*.t and examine the output

Special Thanks to Ron Savage who did the bulk of the work to put this release together.
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session to fix RT#29138 (Patch by Barry Friedman)

to RT#21981 (Reported by erwan) and RT#28516 (Reported by jasoncrowther)

file name pattern used to created session files (Report by appleaday RT#33635
patch by Ron Savage)
* FIX: Patch CGI::Session::Driver::sqlite to add sub DESTROY to fix RT#32932
(Patch by Alexander Batyrshin corrected by Ron Savage)
* FIX: Remove CGI::Session::Seralize::json and t/g4_dbfile_json.t until such time as this code
can be made to work reliably. Both JSON::Syck and JSON::XS have been tried and in both
cases t/g4_dbfile_json.t dies horribly (but differently). Patch POD for CGI::Session to
remove references to JSON. RT#25325 (Reported by bkw patch by Ron Savage)
* NEW: Patch CGI::Session's POD and load() to allow the session/cookie name default of CGISESSID
to be overridden. (Patch by Lee Carmichael RT#33437 reformatted by Ron Savage). Lee has
also patched t/name.t to test the new functionality
* NEW: Split CGI::Session::Serialize::yaml out into its own distro. Get it hot from CPAN!
* NEW: Add Build.PL for Module::Build users. This also requires adding PL_FILES => {}
to Makefile.PL to beat ExtUtils::MakeMaker over the head otherwise it executes
'perl Build.PL Build'
* NEW: Support specification of both the id column name and the a_session column name in the
sessions table by extending the options acceptable in CGI::Session->new(....{here}).
Allow: {TableName => 'session' IdColName => 'my_id' DataColName => 'my_data'}.
Default: {TableName => 'sessions' IdColName => 'id' DataColName => 'a_session'}.
Allow any 1 2 or 3 of these options. Missing keys default as specified.
(Patch by Chris RT#2224. Implemented differently by Ron Savage). Supported drivers:
o MySQL (native to CGI::Session)
o ODBC (separate distro CGI::Session::Driver::odbc V 1.01)
o Oracle (separate distro CGI::Session::Driver::oracle V 1.01)
o Postgres (native)
o SQLite (native)

* NEW: File driver now has option to disable flock (for those running
Win 9x VMS MacPerl VOS and RISC OS). (Matt LeBlanc)
* FIX: If DBI driver was initialized using 'Handle' Driver::DBI::init()
returned false and Driver::new() thought init faild and kept returning
undef. The problem was fixed by making sure Driver::DBI::init() returned
true. (Sherzod)
* Added .*cgisess.* to disclude cgisess.db cgisess.id and any session
files created in the t directory. (Matt LeBlanc)
* FIX: File driver now respects $CGI::Session::File::FileName for 3.9x
compatibility. (Matt LeBlanc)
* FIX: Default serializer now properly handles data structures that appear
more than once in the serialized data structure (before it'd result in data
structures that were equivalent but did not have the same address). (Matt LeBlanc)
* FIX: File driver now localizes the filehandle to avoid any possibility
of extended locking in persistent environments (Matt LeBlanc)
* FIX: File driver now locks the file when retrieving the session data (Matt LeBlanc)
* NEW: DBI Drivers now support a lazy loaded database handle. This is useful with the
CGI::Application plugin system. If the session is never used the database handle may not
not need to be created. The syntax is to use a code ref:
Handle => sub {DBI->connect} (Mark Stosberg)
Finally be aware that since 4.0 some people have reported problems with
the auto-flushing code. There may be an unresolved. You always call
flush() to be safe. Input or code contributions for the issue are
