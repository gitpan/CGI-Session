.::CGI::Session::. version 0.01
===================

.:DESCRIPTION:.
Front end utility for Apache::Session by Jeffrey Baker and set of modules it comes with.
The interface is pretty similar to that of CGI.pm with some additional methods.
So it shouldn't take users long to get used to it.

.:Example:.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use CGI;
    use CGI::Session::DB_File;

    my ($cgi, $Session, $sid);

    $cgi = new CGI;

    $sid = $cgi->cookie("Example2_SID");

    $Session = new CGI::Session::DB_File($sid, {FileName=>'sessions.db', LockDirectory=>'.'});

    if ($sid) {
        $Session->load_param($cgi);

    }

    my $cookie = $cgi->cookie(-name=>'Example2_SID', -value=>$Session->id, -expires=>"+1d");

    print $cgi->header(-cookie=>$cookie),
        $cgi->start_html("CGI::Session / Example 2"),
        $cgi->h2("Example 2");


    if ($cgi->param('_cmd') eq 'save') {

        $Session->save_param($cgi);
        print $cgi->div("Thanks, for your registration. Just hope that we're not one of those bastards who keep sending you all kinds of spam.");

        # now you could do smt more with that email, but we won't.

    } else {

        $Session->param('name') and
            print $cgi->div("Wellcome back" . $Session->param('name') );

        print $cgi->h2("Please, subscribe to our magazine");
        print $cgi->start_form,
            $cgi->hidden(-name=>'_cmd', -value=>'save'),
            $cgi->div("Your name:"),
            $cgi->textfield(-name=>'name', -size=>40),
            $cgi->div("Your email address:"),
            $cgi->textfield(-name=>'email', -size=>40),$cgi->br,
            $cgi->submit(-value=>'Subscribe'),
            $cgi->end_form;

    }


    print $cgi->end_html;
