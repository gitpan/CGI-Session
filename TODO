This is a working collaborative TODO list. Please keep it up to date as you see
fit. In the short term, let's focus on what it takes to make a solid 4.0
release!

[COMPATIBILITY]

 - '-ip_match' is missing in 4.x. The code should be easy port from 3.x, as well
    as some docs. Also, $CGI::Session::IP_MATCH needs to be supported. 

 - Resolve this question of consistency versus compatibility for expires('param',0);
   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12244228

[TEST COVERAGE]
 - All existing tests need to pass. 

[INTERNALS]

 - Make the code easier to follow by moving subroutines
   next to their documentation. That allows you to confirm
   at a glance that the code and documentation for a routine
   match, and keep them in sync easier. 

[ MISSING FEATURES / WISHLIST ] 

 - Allow CGI::Session->new( $dbh );
   This syntax would automatically figure out the CGI::Session driver name
   based on the DBI driver. This can't work in every case because there is
   not a 1-to-1 correspondence. For example, the PureSQL driver is an alternate
   database backend. Still, because it can address the common cases with MySQL
   and PostgreSQL drivers, it seems worthwhile. 

 - Consider adding a redirect() method, as proposed here:
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2603 
   The bug report has some starter code, but docs and tests are still needed.  

 - Ticket #8090 Change to clear method allows clearing based on regular expression. 
   Code patch has been submitted. Still need docs and test.
