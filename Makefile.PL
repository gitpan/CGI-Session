#### WARNING ####

If you are using custom CGI::Session drivers they may not be compatible with the current driver specifications. 
You will need to make some changes to your drivers' code before proceeding with this installation to make it 
compatible with CGI::Session 4.x.

Fortunately, current driver specifications are a lot easier to adapt to. Should you have any assistance 
re-coding your current drivers, please let me know.

Current driver specs are documented in CGI/Session/Driver.pm
